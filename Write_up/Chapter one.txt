### Chapter One: Introduction

#### 1.1 Background of the Study

Agriculture remains a crucial sector in Nigeria, providing employment to over 70% of the rural population. Yobe State, located in the northeastern part of Nigeria, is no exception. The state’s agricultural sector, which focuses on crops such as millet, sorghum, and groundnuts, heavily relies on manual labor due to the limited mechanization of farming processes. However, finding and managing farm laborers remains a significant challenge due to factors such as distance, communication barriers, and lack of a streamlined process for matching laborers with farmers.

In recent years, technology has been utilized to bridge gaps in various sectors, including agriculture. The emergence of web-based tools and platforms offers a new approach to managing agricultural labor more efficiently. These tools have the potential to connect farm laborers with farmers in need, streamline hiring processes, and provide data-driven insights for better management.
